					<h2> Problems</h2>
	      		<p>The problem for this lab was to make to make a sorting hat system for Hogwarts and use conditonals to get different outputs based on different inputs. We chose define each house as a variable and print the variable output after the input was sorted. We had to print out all of code in java so we used console.log. We wrote css, java, and html 	to make this lab superb!</p>

				  <h2> Challenges</h2>
	      		<p>One challenge we had was getting a variable as an output. We originally got undefined as out output. The problem was that I was trying to get a number from the function when I should have been trying to get a string. Another problem we had was not defining the different house variables. They were set in an array but I had to define them for the to print out.</p>

	      		<p>Above are the problems we had and the challanges we faced. We tried to be as creative as possible with this lab. We placed a heavy emphasis on making the css look nice and clean for the lab.</p>
