					<h2> Problems</h2>
				</div>
	      		<p>The problem for this lab was to make a function and utilize that function in our webpage. We chose to find out the users favorite food and then break	the letters of the food up and sort those letters. Then we give the output back to the user as their favorite food sorted. We wrote css, java, and html 	to make this lab superb!</p>

				</div>
	      		<p>One challenge we had was trying to add spaces to the final output. If the user inputed a food that was multiple words it would sort all the letters together and erdicate the words. We wanted to sort the words and letters seperately by adding spaces.</p>
	    	<div id ="results">
					<h2> Results</h2>
				</div>
	      		<p>Above are the problems we had and the challanges we faced. Below is the script output of our js. We tried to be as creative as possible with this lab. We placed a heavy emphasis on making the css look nice and clean for the lab.</p>
