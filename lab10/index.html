					<h2> Problems</h2>

	      		<p>The problem for this lab was to write javascript for the web and to take an input from the java code to and shuffle the input back into the webpage. We had to add a button and an event listener to check for an input click.</p>

	      		<p>One challenge we had was using the shuffe array from lab7. We had to find the shuffle array that professor Modes found on stackoverflow and use that one. Another challenge we had was writing the java script to appear. I had to add "window.onload" to make sure the java would run and show up. </p>
