      <h2> Challenges</h1>
    		<div id="challenges">
      		<p> The challenge today was:
						<ul>
							<li> To create a pseudocode for an everday task </li>
							<li> To create a pseudocode for a computer task </li>
							<li> To turn the computer task pseudocode into comments </li>
							<li> To organize our index.html in a presentable manner by using CSS and neat coding habits </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
    		</div>
    <h2> Problems</h1>
    	<div id="problems">
      	<p>
					<ul>
						<li> The steps for an everyday task are a lot more difficult to break down into pseudocode. As a result, my psuedocode for an everyday task ended up being way longer and more descriptive than necessary and a lot more complicated than writing the computer task code </li>
						<li> When I try to auto adjust the margin of my results div, nothing changes and the text is still stuck in the middle of the page. What your left with is what the Results are under. I would love to be a able to format the page correctly but I am struggling with making sure everything can go in the right space </li>
						<li> I had to rename the CSS sheet for this lab to lab4.css which ended up breaking the connection and I had to fix it later on </li>
						<li> One feature I didn't include in my wordle code is the text boxes for the keyboard that let you know which letter you have already chosen. I also didn't include code for "hard" mode wordle which makes you unable to input a word if the letters you use match the letters you have previously used in a failed attempt </li>
						<li> Lastly, I was confused about the author block but I filled it out to the best of my ability </li>

							<h3> Pseudocode a Computer Task</h3>
								// Create Wordle:
								  // Print the blank word table
								    // Print a 5x6 table of blank boxes
								    // Generate a 5 letter English word that is only known to the computer
								    // Loop through each line
								      // Print a, b , c , d , e , f , g , h, i , j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, or z
								  // Accept user input
								    // Accept alphabetical input
								    // Deny non-alphabetical input
								  // Validate input acceptability
								    // Accept 5 letter English word
								    // Deny 5 letter Non-English word
								    // Deny nonsensical 5 letter arrangement
								  // Test of correct, incorrect, or half-correct condition
								    // Loop through each letter in the 5 letter English word
								      // Print green box if the letter is correct and in the right space of the word
								      // Print yellow box if the letter is correct but in the wrong space of the word
								      // Keep blank box if the letter is incorrect and not used in the word
								  // Test of win, lose, or move on condition
								    // Loop through input line
								      // Print win if user input matches the pre generated 5 letter English word
								      // Loop to next line down and repeat steps 2-5 if the 5 letter English word inputted does not match the 5 letter English word that was pre generated
								      // If loop line > 6, print lose

								<h3> Pseudocode an Everyday Task</h3>
									// How to Win Monopoly:
										// Acquire proprietorial assets
											// Best colors to get are yellow and green. Red is too hard to land on and Blue is a gamble. The rest of the properties should be secondary acquisitions.
										// Establish a foothold
											// Try to get two of the 3 colors as fast as possible in order to have trading leverage.
										// Look to block rival colors
											// You can do this before or after step 2 however you should hold onto rival colors for as long as possible either to trade for a critical property or to prevent early building.
										// Double down on color monopoly
											// Most important rule for longevity in the game is to have a full set of colors so sacrificing other assets in order to get a color monopoly is worth it.
										// Take advantage of debt
											// If someone owes you money and they canâ€™t pay, try to acquire their properties instead. People will give you anything to stay in the game so use that advantage to establish a greater foothold in order to gain map pressure.
										// Map Pressure
											// Try to acquire color properties that are close to one another for multiple chances of rent collection.
										// Houses and Hotels
											// Once you double down on monopoly, priority number 1 is to establish assets on that property. Buy as much as you can in houses and hotels as they are liquid assets and can always be traded back to the bank for their original price.
										// Go to jail
											// Once you have established your properties and lines have been drawn in the game, the next step is to repeatedly go to jail. In jail you can collect rent and it stops you moving for 4 turns.
										// Become a mogul
											// Repeat as much of the steps above needed to win the game. Keep in mind that no matter how good a strategy you have in monopoly, you can always get screwed over any time in the game so always be precautious.
