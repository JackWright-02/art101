					<h2> Problems</h2>
				</div>
	      		<p> 	The problem for this lab was to finally introduce variables intro our coding and this can be considered our first real bit of coding. We had to make a js and define a bunch of variables and then link that js to our html and upload it to our website. We defined variables for the jaguar f-type and included a picture for reference. </p>

				</div>
	      		<p> 	One challenge that was hard to figure out was the spacing for the webpage, particularly when it came to aligning the image correctly. One trick we figured out was that the image spacing was most affected by where it was written in the html document. </p>
	    	<div id ="results">
					<h2> Results</h2>
				</div>
	      		<p> 	Above are the problems we had and the challanges we faced. Below is the script output of our js. We tried to be as creative as possible with this lab. We placed a heavy emphasis on making the css look nice and clean for the lab.</p>
