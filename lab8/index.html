					<h2> Problems</h2>
				</div>
	      		<p>The problem for this lab was to make an anon function and callback to our orginal function. We chose to sqaure root the results of our orginal function and apply them to our array. We had to print out all of code in java so we used console.log. We wrote css, java, and html 	to make this lab superb!</p>

				</div>
	      		<p>One challenge we had was trying to use addition to a string. We originally created our array as a set of strings so when we went to add numbers to them, the numbers would just go infront or behind our orginal numbers and wouldn't add. Another problem we had was not putting "Math" infront of the square root but we fixed that.</p>

	      		<p>Above are the problems we had and the challanges we faced. We tried to be as creative as possible with this lab. We placed a heavy emphasis on making the css look nice and clean for the lab.</p>
