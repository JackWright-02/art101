					<h2> Problems</h2>
				</div>
	      		<p>The problem for this lab was to take the variables we were using in Lab 5 and to turn those variables into arrays and objects so that they can be easier to use in our webpage. We had to write new java script to give the arrays and objects values. We then wrote new java script to print those arrays and objects onto our webpage.</p>

	      		<p>One challenge we had was trying to write the code for the object. Another challenge we faced was the javascript not printing myMainRide and that took quite a while to fix. </p>

	      		<p>Above are the problems we had and the challanges we faced. Below is the script output of our js. We tried to be as creative as possible with this lab. We placed a heavy emphasis on making the css look nice and clean for the lab.</p>
