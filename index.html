		<p>Welcome to my first web page!</p>

		<p>This class is kinda tiring and boring but also fun.</p>

		<p>I guess that we are doing all the easy stuff right now but once this class picks up speed ill be crying!!!!</p>

		<p>By typing a bunch of numbers out I learned that for each line in my webpage can contain a maximum of 1000 characters. However, Atom can only hold about 500 chacrters per line so two line of Atom is like one line on my webpage. I'm curious towards CSS and was wondering if these programs could be utilized to attach negative space to text boxes. Inverted colors??????? Oh wait... I just learned if you include sentenes with spaces then the line does break evenly with the page smmothly. look at that!</p>
