      <p> Hello sorry for the wierd heading above. My name is Jack Wright and I am a sophmore BMECBA major living in oakes college. I like to play tennis and read. I realized that last year I ate a lot less then this year which is funny considering that I don't have a dining hall pass this quarter. Love to write random stuff :). </p>
